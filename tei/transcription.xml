                <p>I received
                    <lb/>your welcome letter. I was
                    <lb/>very pleased to hear from
                    <lb/>you and to know you
                    <lb/>spent such a happy xmas
                    <lb/>and had every thing you
                    <lb/>wanted. I hope you are quite
                    <lb/>well at the present time<supplied>.</supplied>
                    <lb/>I was heart broken the other
                    <lb/>night I dreamed you was 
                    <lb/>dead and I could not 
                    <lb/>see you and you never
                    <lb/>left any message for me
                    <lb/>so I woke up â€¦
                    
                    <pb/>and I was so frightened till
                    <lb/>I realised it was only a
                    <lb/>dream. I hope I shall
                    <lb/>meet you once more in life
                    <lb/>and have a happy time
                    <lb/>again. Let me know are
                    <lb/>you very well this winter
                    <lb/>and if your cough does be
                    <lb/>as bad as usual and are
                    <lb/>you able to get out to mass
                    <lb/>every Sunday<supplied>.</supplied> I hope when
                    <lb/>you go to town you go 
                    <lb/>down to the chapel as
                    <lb/>you used to do years ago
                    <lb/>and pray and spend an 
                    <lb/>hour with our Lord and 
                    <lb/>remember us all there<supplied>.</supplied> 
                    
                    <pb/>This is the second or third
                    <lb/>Sunday I have missed
                    <lb/>mass since I came here<supplied>.</supplied>
                    <lb/>it snowed last night and
                    <lb/>all the morning so that
                    <lb/>it was impossible to get
                    <lb/>out. We are having a very
                    <lb/>severe winter so far. We
                    <lb/>are all well thank God
                    <lb/>and I have not had
                    <lb/>a severe cold in a long
                    <lb/>time. I think it is 
                    <lb/>dreadful to stay from
                    <lb/>mass. The world is all
                    <lb/>very well till our last day
                    <lb/>comes and then what
                    <lb/>have we but what little
                    
                    <pb/>good we have done for our
                    <lb/>souls. Dear Mother don't
                    <lb/>think I am comencing a
                    <lb/>sermon but I see to much
                    <lb/>and there is to many sudden
                    <lb/>deaths it is terrible. I was
                    <lb/>perfectly surprised to hear
                    <lb/>of <persName key="LOUGHPers_0005">Mike Fitzgerald's</persName> death
                    <lb/>how suddint. let me know
                    <lb/>did he have the priest
                    <lb/>or did he think he was
                    <lb/>going to die. I should
                    <lb/>think it would make
                    <lb/>fine turn a new leaf
                    <lb/>and be a better man<supplied>.</supplied> it
                    <lb/>was very sad I do not
                    <lb/>think he ever had much
                    <lb/>happiness in this life<supplied>.</supplied>
